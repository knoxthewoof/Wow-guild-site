        <h2>A bit about the weirdos within:</h2>
        <p class="guild">
            
            We are an unruly bunch on WoW friends that in some cases have raided together for years and in other cases a few months.
            Just a group 20 and 30 somethings (or 78, you know who you are.) sitting around in vent (while we raid, otherwise vent is pretty dead)
            playfully picking on each other and slaying pixelated dragons. We don't take ourselves too serious, but require anyone interested in raiding with us to
            respect the time of others. Don't show up late, don't be an asshole etc. etc. You can have a dirty mind and a foul mouth
            just don't have a foul mind and a dirty mouth. I don't know what the fuck that means either, but fuck it you seem to still
            be reading this. I will get into what we are looking for and all that later.
